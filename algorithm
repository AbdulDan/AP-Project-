Data of each wave is stored in a rolling queue array where the array is overwritten progressively in a repeating fashion. 
When each wave is emitted, the current time, as well as the position and velocity of the source, is stored in an object to 
be used later. To find which wave is currently being detected by the observer, the program goes through each wave to 
try to find the closest wave that has passed the observer, if any. If an observer wave is found, the perceived 
frequency and amplitude are calculated using the vector position and velocity of the observer as well as the vector 
position and velocity of the source from the time of wave emission (using the source wave data structure mentioned earlier) 
to find the components of the projected velocities of the source and observer in the relative direction of the observer and source,
respectively.
