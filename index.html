                <p>
                    Simulation of the Doppler effect, particularized in the context of sound waves and explored through scenarios where a wave-emitting source and wave-detecting observer move with a user-controllable position, velocity, or acceleration.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section">Source</h3>
                <p>
                    Source is controllable in position, velocity, and acceleration and is always in one of three states: stationary, constant velocity, or constant acceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Source emits waves with a constant or variable frequency and constant amplitude.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section">Waves</h3>
                <p>
                    Waves propagate in time with their amplitude attenuating exponentially.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only crests are illustrated in the rendering of waves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When multiple waves collide, interference is not accounted for at the moment.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section">Observer</h3>
                <p>
                    Observer, similarly, is controllable in position, velocity, and acceleration and is always in one of three states: stationary, constant velocity, or constant acceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observer detects a wave at a time and records its perceived frequency and amplitude.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section">Functionality</h3>
                <p>
                    TIME button group can be accessed with key P to pause the simulation, possibly to change the properties of the source and observer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BUFFER button group can be accessed with keys S and R to save the current simulation time and restore the saved time later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SOUND button group can be accessed with key M to interpret the observer signal in time as a sound wave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TWAVE button group can be accessed with key W to highlight the properties of the wave that is observed at the current time. This includes but is not limited to the position and velocity of the source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FMOD button group can be accessed with key F to modulate the frequency of the source signal in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CONTROL button group can be accessed with key C to switch between modifying the properties of the source and observer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TYPE button group can be accessed with key T to switch between modifying the position, velocity, and acceleration of the controlled object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DIRECTION button group can be accessed with keys ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, and 0 to set the direction of the vector (including origin) of the motion type of the controlled object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MAGNITUDE button group can be accessed with keys 1, 2, and 3 to set the magnitude of the vector (excluding origin) of the motion type of the controlled object.
